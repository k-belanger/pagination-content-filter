## Project Objective:
Using progressive enhancement and unobtrusive JavaScript, add pagination to the page in order to filter through a long list of students.

## Project Functions:
- The pagination is added dynamically to the page with JavaScript.
- It dynamically adds the appropriate number of pagination buttons needed for the amount of students provided.
- Each pagination button shows the appropriate group of 10 students from the list when clicked. For example, button 2 shows students 11-20, 3 shows 21-30 and so on. 
- It works with any number of students.
- By default, on page load, it shows the first 10 students.

## Exceeds Expectations:
- Dynamically add a search bar to filter the students by name.
- If no matches were forund a message displays that tells the user so.
